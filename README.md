# OS-EX-1-ASSEMBLING-THE-SYSTEM---CASE-STUDY

## AIM:
To assemble the system.
## MATERIALS REQUIRED:
1. Computer case.
2. CPU.
3. RAM.
4. Thermal kit.
5. MotherBoard.
## PROCEDURE:
### 1. PREPARE YOUR WORKSPACE:
Choose a clean, well-lit, and static-free area to work in.

Place the motherboard on a non-conductive
surface like its anti-static bag.
### 2. INSTALL THE CPU (CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT):
 Open the CPU socket on the motherboard.

 Align the CPU with the socket, ensuring the
notches match.

 Gently place the CPU into the socket without
applying any force.

 Close the socket lever to secure the CPU.

### 3. INSTALL THE CPU COOLER:
Apply thermal paste to the CPU
(if not pre-applied on the cooler).

Attach the CPU cooler according to the
manufacturer's instructions.

Connect the cooler's fan to the CPU
fan header on the motherboard.

Align the notch on the RAM stick
with the slot on the motherboard.

Press down evenly on both ends of
the RAM stick until it clicks into place.

### 5. INSTALL THE GPU (GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT):
If your CPU has integrated graphics, this
step may be unnecessary.

Align the GPU with the PCIe slot
on the motherboard.

Push down gently until it clicks into
place.

Secure the GPU with screws to the case (if
required).
